## Ideas

The main idea for this project is to develop an AI-powered conversational chatbot that can assist IT support staff by answering common technology questions. The chatbot, nicknamed PITA, will allow IT workers to query a knowledge base on topics like computer issues, software troubleshooting, account access, and general technical how-to's. PITA will leverage natural language processing to understand queries and guide users to solutions with a text-based dialog. The system will tap into existing databases and documents to power the chatbot's conversational abilities and knowledge.
