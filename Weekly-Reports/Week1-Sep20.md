# Team Report & Updates
  - ### Last Week’s Goals:
      - This is the first week of meeting as a group to work on the project. Last week we worked on the requirements report and brainstorming use cases for our product. 
  - ### This Week's Progress & Issues:
      - The frontend engineer's started the initial installs for Llama and all of the required Python files. Downloading Visual Studio code and installing the proper files worked for the initial download of Llama. We learned how to use the command line as well as many different commands to fetch and download files. I had trouble creating a virtual environment and downloading Ubuntu to run a script file. I also had problems downloading the necessary modules for Python. I am currently stuck on running the llama 2 chatbot, many different Python modules are needed, such as pytorch. As of now, all of the current progress is on Adam's laptop. As for the backend engineer's updates, we installed MySql and began by creating a database called `IT_Department`. As of right now the database is being hosted locally on Gabriella's laptop but we may change this later on. We learned how to successfully create a database using the MySql command line. We researched ways to get data from a teams chat into a database but had trouble finding a method that doesn't require direct access to the teams channel. We are stuck on how to retrieve the data/ get the nessaccary permissions and access to the HelpDesk channel. Some team members had trouble installing MySql. 
   
  - ### Next Week’s Plan:
      - Frontend engineers goal is to to actually run the chatbot with the given files as well as possibly integrate it into a website that we will develop and design. Adam is working on the chatbot itself while Karen and Treasure work on developing and designing a website. Another goal is to get the installations on everyone's laptop to run the chatbot. The backend engineers goal is to have a database created with some data and begin working on a method to get data from the IT department's teams chat into the database. We plan on talking to a full time staff member in the IT department to ask about getting access in order to use Microsoft Graph API to get the data from the team's channel. 


# Contributions of individual team members
  - ### Gabriella:
      - Last Week’s Goals:
          - Last week I worked on completing the Requirements Report with our product outline and use cases as well as looking up tutorials on how to create a database in MySql.
      - This Week's Progress & Issues:
          - This week I downloaded MySql on my laptop and created a database that I am currently hosting locally on my computer. I learned about the Microsoft Graph API and thought about trying to use it to get the data from the teams channel but we don't have proper access for it to work. Having trouble determining the best route to get the data into the database that I created. Also learned markdown in order to create the weekly reports in GitHub.
      - Next Week’s Plan:
          -  Next week my plan is to get some of the data into the database. I think based on the scope and the purpose of this product, it may make more sense to manually enter all of the data into the database either using the MySql command line or putting it all into an excel sheet and uploading that file into the database.
  
  - ### Adam:
      - Last Week’s Goals:
          - Understanding and finding proper guides to set up and download the llama 2 chatbot. Mostly researched Llama and other chatbot resources.
      - This Week's Progress & Issues:
          - This week I worked on multiple installations needed to get the chatbot up and running. I downloaded and ran the initial Llama 2 files as well as Ubuntu/Linux.
      - Next Week’s Plan:
          - My plan for next week is to actually run the chatbot with given files as well as possibly integrating it into a website. Also have to donwload pytorch and any other nessaccary libraries and tools for creating the chatbot. 
        
  - ### Treasure:
      - Last Week’s Goals:
         - Establishing a gameplan for how to create and implement a chatbot using Llama 2, while also researching for solutions on how to embed the chatbot into a webpage browser.
      - This Week's Progress & Issues:
          - This week, we made some more progress on how to create the chatbot using Llama. Currently trying to download all of the necessary programs and softwares to get the chatbot up and running. We are also doing more research to see which method we would like to use to create a webpage while using python, considering between flask and django.
      - Next Week’s Plan:
         - Next week, we plan to have the chatbot running with a clear idea of how we would like to approach the frontend interface. 
        
  - ### Harkaren:
      - Last Week’s Goals:
          - The goal last week was to complete the assignment that involved a use case. Also getting an idea of starting the setup for the chatbot using Llama, which mostly consisted of researching youtube videos and getting a better undertsanding on where to start and download Llama. 
      - This Week's Progress & Issues:
        - My plan this week is to start researching more/developing the website along with the other frontend engineers. Also install any other applications that will be needed so everyone has everything on their laptops 
      - Next Week’s Plan:
        - Have the chatbot succesfully working with the website. 
        
  - ### Elizabeth:
      - Last Week’s Goals: 
          - Last week as a team we worked on the requirements and I find my use case for the project. Also the backend team decided to install MySQL server and use that for this project. 
      - This Week's Progress & Issues:
           - This week I am trying to install the MySQL server to my personal computer and couldn't be able to. Tried multiple times and failed. Most probably ask for help or find an alternative way to make it work. 
      - Next Week’s Plan:
           - Once the MySQL server installed start adding data's into the database. In order to process this I have to do more research on data entries to make it more efficient for the project.
