# Team Report & Updates
  - ### Last Week’s Goals:
      -  Last week Treasure got the website working and connected to the dialoGPT model. It is now connected to our database and when you ask it a question that resembles a question that is found in the database, it will return a response. At first it didn't work in codespaces but the three of us got together and got it to work by compiling all the code needed for both the website and the database into one folder. Need to work on the fallback mechanism as right now it will just say "Sorry I don’t have a response for that" for questions beyond the scope of the current database.
  - ### This Week's Progress & Issues:
      -  This week our team focused on working on the Alpha assignment. Karen created the PowerPoint and Gabi helped fill in the information about our process, architechture and toolchain. Adam and Gabi worked on the documentation, making sure we provided step by step instructions in our top level README for users to read through and follow. We met as a team to record our demo and presentation. Treasure has been working on implementing a login system for our chatbot. 
  - ### Next Week’s Plan:
      -  Try to implement a different chatbot than DialoGPT. If it works, it means reconnecting it to the website and our database and then updating our documentation. Continue working on making a login system. Work on writing a user manual in addition to our developer guidelines. Set up our project repo in a way that aligns with the peer review assignment.

# Contributions of individual team members
  - ### Gabriella:
      - Last Week’s Goals:
          -  Last week I met with Adam and Treasure to get the website to connect with the database. We successfully connected it all and have a working chatbot that pulls the responses from our database. Managed to get it working in codespaces. Cleaned up the repo by deleting all old files that were not being used.
      - This Week's Progress & Issues:
          -  This week my main focus was working on the Alpha release. I worked on solidifying our toolchain and technical processes, writing documentation so that a user or developer can easily follow the instructions to build, test, and run our project. I worked on creating the presentation for the demo as well as did lots of testing to make sure that our demo would run smoothly and that our documentation steps worked during implementation. 
      - Next Week’s Plan:
          -  Making sure our repository and project is good for the peer review assignment. Fix it so that it has everything on the checklist and make sure all documentation is set and works. Research other chatbot frameworks and try to implement a smarter model. 
  
  - ### Adam:
      - Last Week’s Goals:
          -  Last week were working on trying to implement a login system for both users and an admin. Allowing the users to login via ID, and allowing the admin to view the user history logs according to user ID.
      - This Week's Progress & Issues:
          -  Pivoted to focus on ensuring the alpha release was ready. Updated README file to have the build, test, and run instructions. Tested the application with the directions i made multiple times from scratch successfully 
      - Next Week’s Plan:
          -  Ensure everything is up-to-date for the peer review and nothing breaks until then
        
        
  - ### Treasure:
      - Last Week’s Goals:
          -  Last week we completed the Alpha and made sure all of the builds, tests, and instructions were successful and running.
      - This Week's Progress & Issues:
          -  The framework of the login system is working for both the users and the admin. Now all that is needed is the fix up and finalize the specifications.
      - Next Week’s Plan:
          -  By next week we will continue to finalize the chatbot and add in any other functions that may be needed for the final release. Also, making sure our instructions and Readme is clear and concise for peer reviews.
          
  - ### Harkaren:
      - Last Week’s Goals:
          - Last weeks goal was finally having the chatbot up running and everything was conneceted sucessfully. The chatbot was able to give responses once a question was asked from the database. 
      - This Week's Progress & Issues:
          -  This week we all met to complete the ALPHA assignment after dividing it last week. Worked with eachother to create the powerpoint that we used to present for our ALPHA assignment. In addition Treasure is looking into implementing a staff login system to use. 
      - Next Week’s Plan:
          -  We will begin to see if anything else can be added to the chatbot to clean it up or add some features . Primarily focusing on our peer review to see if the goals can be met before it happens.
